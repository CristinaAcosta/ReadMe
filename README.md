## Description: 
This is a markdown file that is written to communicate important information about my project to other programmers. I have written it using the node installation so that I am prompted with questions when using inquirer. I can then write my answers and have them displayed on the markdown file. 
        
## Installation: 
NPM Inquirer is needed to use this program. In your integrated terminal, the user would need to install the package

Then you are able to load the code using the inquirer call “inq.prompt()”

The command line is a string that prompts the user for information 
Function: is used to pull a list of questions
Ans: used to place where you want your answers to be.
